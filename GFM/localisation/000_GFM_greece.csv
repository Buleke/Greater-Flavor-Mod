EVTNAME5000001;Greek Revolutionaries Make Their Demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC5000001;Ioannis Makrygiannis the leader of the revolution of 1821 against the Ottomans has begun to organise various rebel bands against our Autocratic Regime, declaring our Bavarian monarch just as bad as the sultan in Constantinople, however, while the situation is rapidly deterating it hasn't spiraled out of control just yet, rejecting his demands might see the country head into all out revolt. It all depends on our response.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT5000001OPTA;We cannot take the risk wholly capitulate to his demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT5000001OPTB;His terms are outrageous and so is compromising, declare him an outlaw.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT5000001OPTC;Make token conncessions, that will surely starve out his movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME5000002;Constitutional Rebels Mobilise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC5000002;Ioannis Makrygiannis and his rebels have had enough of the reactionary nature of our Bavarian king and his Bavarian Bureaucracy his armies have begun to march towards $CAPITAL$. hour by hour more parts of our army and peasantry are joining him and it seems that now the situation is completely untenable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT5000002OPTA;Call all those still loyal to defend his highness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME5000003;Revolutionary Armies Surround Royal Palace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC5000003;Despite our best attempts at dispersing rebel activity in the last few years it has all come to nought as rebel armies surround the Old Royal Palace and demand that the king immediately be depowered and a constituion be put in his place with universal suffrage for all Greek Men. We may however still have a chance if we rapidly call on any loyalists, however, fighting these changes will costs our country dearly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT5000003OPTA;We must accept our defeat, the rebels have won this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT5000003OPTB;No Concessions tell Steinstorf to rally any one still loyal and fire at will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
