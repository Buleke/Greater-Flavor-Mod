Peru_rejects_GCO_title;Peru rejects a diplomatic union!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Peru_rejects_GCO_desc; The Peruvians have dug a line in the sand and refused our ultimatum. Their defiance might prove us weak to our neighbors if we don't act now. Simon Bolivar's ultimate dream now rests in our hands. 
Do we accept their sovereignty at the cost of our international prestige, or do we take what's rightfully ours?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Chile_joins_Peru_against_GCO_title;Chilean intervention!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Chile_joins_Peru_against_GCO_desc;The Chileans have entered the war on the side of Peru and Bolivia, seeing the threat that Gran Colombia clearly presents to their own national interests. Although our generals assure us they aren't a serious threat, the Chilean navy is not to be underestimated. Surely, our rivals in Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires are watching attentively to see what becomes of this conflict. Conflict with our rivals is enevitable, but first we will pacify the Andes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
South_Andean_submission_title;We are victorious;;;;;;;;;;;;;
South_Andean_submission_desc;The war for control of the Andes is over, and while we can now project our influence throughout South America, our legimacy is not yet cemented. While other powers have been watching and waiting, the Argentines and Brazilians are preparing. If they plan to do retaliate against us, we must be ready for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GCO_rejects_PBC_title;The Colombians reject a diplomatic union!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GCO_rejects_PBC_desc; The Colombians have dug a line in the sand and refused our ultimatum. Their defiance might prove us weak to our neighbors if we don't act now. Simon Bolivar's ultimate dream now rests in our hands. 
Do we accept their sovereignty at the cost of our international prestige, or do we take what's rightfully ours?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
North_Andean_submission_title;The North is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
North_Andean_submission_desc;The war for control of the Andes is over, and while we can now project our influence throughout South America, our legimacy is not yet cemented. While other powers have been watching and waiting, the Argentines and Brazilians are preparing. If they plan to do retaliate against us, we must be ready for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
6200_desc;Now that we have centralized the state, it's time to chart the future of our country. Do we remain Peru-Bolivia, or do we become something greater?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62001_desc;We must decide the role our military will play in the Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62002_desc;Now that we've reunited with our North Andean counterparts, we must draft a new constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62003_desc;With threats like Brazil at our back door, we must decide the role our military will play in Gran Colimbia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62004_desc;It would be dishonest to suggest that the Catholic Church plays no role in our citizen's daily lives. It may be necessary to secularize in order to progress as a nation, but it could also help keep our people united to maintain religion in politics. This would be against Bolivar's wishes along with the goals of Andean liberals, but it might increase our support with the lower classes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62005_desc;It began with an abrupt cut to diplomatic ties with Rio de Janeiro, and then a similar incident in Argentina. Our intelligence reports both nations are not only mobilizing their militaries, but the Argentines have seized Uruguay and Paraguay to "restore order" and "eliminate Andean influence" from their borders. Our worst fears have been realized, as the Argentine-Brazilian coalition has been formed to destroy us. If we don't hold them off, the Andean people may never recover from this dismantlement! To arms against our enemies, for The Andes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62006_desc;We have beaten back both the Brazilians and the Argentines in a miraculous upset! Forcing both nations into a treaty to settle our borders once and for all will not only cement the Andes as a powerful country, but also enforce our legitimacy as a Great Power, who will leave her own mark on this planet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

form_Andes_PBC; United the Andes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62007; We've taken Antofagasta, giving us access to the resources of the Atacama. The Criollos of this region still consider themselves South Andean, and in order to avoid unrest we must treat them as equals to Chileans under law.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
