EVTNAME183536;The Seven Laws;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC183536;After president Valentín Gomez Farias implemented his liberal reforms in 1833, revoking power from both the church and the military, the conservatives reacted, with the objective of imposing Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna back on presidency and reverting all of Farias reforms and forming a new constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA183536;Santa Anna is a national hero, put him in charge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB183536;The church and the state must stay separated, it's time for progress!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME183637;Separatist movements!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC183637;This is a disaster! Reports announce that, in consecuence of our recent constitution, many separatists movements have formed all around in the country! With the texans declaring independence right away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA183637;Fight those rebels! The constitution is strong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB183637;There is nothing we can do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44806;Antonio López de Santa Anna;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44806;A general and war hero of Mexican independence, Santa Anna was elected President in 1833. After deposing his liberal vice-president, Santa Anna abrogated the 1826 Constitution and took control of the country as a conservative dictator with both church and military backing. Many Mexican states objected to this centralization of power, and with the rebellion of Tejas to the north the entire country seems to be in a state of chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44806OPTA;The rebels shall be brought to their knees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44126;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Wants to purchase our Northwest Territories!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44126;The American ambassador has informed us that it would be in our best interests to sell the lands north of the Rio Grande to the United States. The amount they offer is considerable, and the northwest territories are of limited value to us, but it is almost an insult that they would think us so eager to give up our rightful territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44126OPTA;No. That land is rightfully ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44126OPTB;We cannot afford for this to escalate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44127;Mexico Has Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44127;The Mexicans have refused our generous offer. Our only recourse is force of arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44127OPTA;Our military could use the target practice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT44127OPTB;We shall surrender our claims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44129;Zachary Taylor marches on Laredo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44129;American general Zachary Taylor has occupied the disputed zones between the Nueces and Rio Grande rivers! Mexican troops quickly attacked his army, but this most likely means war with the americans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA44129;It's time for war, again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
